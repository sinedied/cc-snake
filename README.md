# cc-snake
A (very) simple snake game made during a train trip, to experiment with [cocos2d-js](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-js).

The base project is just a vanilla template generated by `cocos new -l js`, so I only posted the game code as it's contained in a single file.

## Demo
A live demo of the HTML5 packaged version is available [here](http://sinedied.github.io/cc-snake).
